# Phishing-Websites-Detection
Phishing has become a vital concern for security researchers due to the anonymous
structure of the Internet. Phishing is a scam that employs technological and social
engineering deception to steal a customer's bank account information and personal
identification information. Phishing attacks are becoming more prevalent, and hackers
are developing increasingly sophisticated phishing kits due to rapid technological
advancements. They frequently duplicate the targeted site, granting the complete
assailant control of the victim's computer and enabling them to breach any further
security measures. Phishing prevention is necessary for the current environment.
Therefore, more attention to be paid to preventing phishing scams.
This study proposes an intelligent architecture for phishing website detection. The
system architecture includes eight parts: data collection, pre-processing, feature
extraction, data transformation, optimal feature selection, feature scaling, model
evaluation, and prediction as legitimate or phishing. This study uses URLs as a dataset
to detect phishing websites. To prevent data imbalance in this study, we used an equal
quantity of data for benign and phishing. From the URL dataset, 76 features are
extracted; these are then divided into URL-based, path-based, domain-based, and
query-based. Here we used the data transformation technique to convert the object data
type to integer data type and implemented the optimal feature selection technique and
selected the best 20 features. In order to increase the training stability and the model's
performance, applied feature scaling was to change the features such that they are of
comparable size. In the model evaluation, machine learning, deep learning, and multi-
layer ensemble models were used in the study. All the model's performance is calculated
using the confusion matrix, such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score, and the
training times were compared. The performance analysis results show that the Multi-layer ensemble model got the highest accuracy of 98.79% compared with other models.
